# A React Showcase Project
A simple React project made with the purpose of study the framework as well as provide a quick reference for its most recurrent patterns.

## Functionalities

* Responsive design using Bootstrap 4;
* Presents a navigation drawer and an app bar component;
* Use of the Fetch API to get and write data to a mocked REST API;
* Use of `react-router-dom` for routing;
* Stateful parents and stateless children;

## Installing and Running the React Showcase

1. Install (if you haven't already) JSON Server, a fake REST API tool, by running `npm install -g json-server`;
2. Install the dependencies of the project by executing `npm install` in the root directory;
3. Enter the `/json-server` directory and run `json-server db.json`;
4. Back into the root directory of the project, run `npm start`;

## Live Demo
If in a first attempt the application fails to load showing an **application error page**, please try refreshing the browser since the Heroku plataform put applications to sleep after some time of inactivity. The second request should work wihtout any problem.
